 通过调小堆内存模范OOM情况。

## 1. 还原环境

### JVM配置

```yml
# Xms represents the initial size of total heap space
# Xmx represents the maximum size of total heap space

-Xms100m
-Xmx100m
```



### 执行写入数据

```shell
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..2000000} 
do  
  curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9200/test/_doc  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   -d @test.json  
  echo ''
done 
```

## 2. 解决

通过日志可以看出是堆内存溢出，需要通过dump文件进行分析。

### 1. 配置自动dump

ES已经提供以下配置，进程挂掉自动保存dump文件。

```yml
## heap dumps

# generate a heap dump when an allocation from the Java heap fails
# heap dumps are created in the working directory of the JVM
-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError

# specify an alternative path for heap dumps; ensure the directory exists and
# has sufficient space
-XX:HeapDumpPath=data

# specify an alternative path for JVM fatal error logs
-XX:ErrorFile=logs/hs_err_pid%p.log
```



### 2. dump文件分析

通过jvisualVM工具加载 java_pid5873.hprof。

![image-20200422215803731](/Users/song/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20200422215803731.png)

![image-20200422220337174](/Users/song/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20200422220337174.png)



通过分析前20个最大的对象，可以看到SearchHit占用大量的内存。而SearchHit刚好是返回结果类。SearchHit只返回3076，JVM就挂了。说明查询结果数据量太大，导致JVM OOM故障。
